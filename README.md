# Warehouse Inventory App

This is a simple warehouse inventory management app created as a final project for the course **DES422 Web App Development**.

## Features

- User Sign Up and Login
- View inventory with 20 initial items
- Withdraw items and update quantity
- View withdrawal history
- Admin privileges:
  - Add new items
  - View all user withdrawal logs

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Data is handled using **in-memory mock data**

## Backend Note

This project originally included Firebase as a backend for data storage.  
However, for the final submission, it was simplified to use **mock data stored in JavaScript** only,  
in order to meet the assignment’s flexibility and no-backend requirements.

Firebase setup is still available in the code for future expansion but is **not required** to run the current app.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Sign up with a new account or log in using:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin`
3. Withdraw items, search, or (if admin) add new items and view logs.
